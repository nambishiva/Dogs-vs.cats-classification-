# Dogs-vs.cats-classification-
Overview
This repository contains code for a machine learning model that classifies images as either dogs or cats. The model is built using Python and TensorFlow/Keras, and it utilizes convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image classification.

Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing the model consists of thousands of images of dogs and cats. The dataset is divided into training and testing sets, with a split of 80% for training and 20% for testing. Each image is labeled as either a dog or a cat.

Model Architecture
The model architecture consists of several convolutional layers followed by max-pooling layers to extract features from the input images. Dropout layers are used for regularization to prevent overfitting. The final layer is a dense layer with a softmax activation function to output the probability of each class (dog or cat).

Training
The model is trained using the training dataset with a categorical cross-entropy loss function and the Adam optimizer. During training, data augmentation techniques such as rotation, scaling, and flipping are applied to increase the robustness of the model.

Evaluation
The model is evaluated using the testing dataset to assess its performance in classifying unseen images. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are calculated to measure the model's performance.
